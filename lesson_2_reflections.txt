What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	Initializing a git repository creates the file .git.  This will allow 
	commits to be saved for this repository and keep all history of commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?

	Place the file you changed into the staging are using git add and then 
	use git diff without any arguments to print out the changes made to the 
	file in the staging as compares to the version currently saved in the 
	working directory.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your 
history organized? How would branches help?

	When you want to test out an experiemental feature that may or may not 
	be incorporated later without while maintaining (bug fixing and such) 
	the main (master) string of files.
